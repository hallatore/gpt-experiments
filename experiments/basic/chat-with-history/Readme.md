# Chat with history

Takes user input from terminal and sends it to gpt. Prints the respons in the terminal.

## Note 

Chat history is kept. So you can ask it follow up questions.

## Example

```
PROMPT: List 5 dog names for a bulldog         
GPT: 1. Tank
2. Brutus
3. Hercules
4. Bella
5. Duke
PROMPT: the dog is a girl
GPT: 1. Rosie
2. Daisy
3. Lola
4. Ruby
5. Stella
```

Note that the history is kept. So GPT processes all messages each request.
